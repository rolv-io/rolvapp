# Installation Instructions
## System Requirements
Any hardware that is able to run a recent chrome browser should be able to run the desktop app.
However, for smooth performance we have the following recommendations:

- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (2 GHz+).
- **RAM**: 8 GB+ for resource-heavy apps (e.g., IDEs, communication tools).
- **Storage**: SSD for faster load times (1 GB free storage)
- **Internet connection**: Required as the app relies on web APIs for certain services.


## Install the dependencies
Currently, the only external dependency that doesn't come with the app is **R**. R is a free, 
open-source programming language and software environment primarily used for statistical 
computing and data analysis. Currently, we need this dependency to perform data analysis tasks.
If you already have R installed, you can skip this step. It is probably a good idea
to use a latest version of R, though.

### How to install R


#### Windows 11

To install R on a Windows system, follow these steps:

1. Download R
  - Go to the official R project website: <https://cran.r-project.org>.

# Starting the app and post-installation verification
Now that we have all the prerequisites installed, we can start playing around with RolvDesktop! If you have
trouble opening the app because of security reasons, follow the steps below:

  - **For Mac users:** Right-click on the app‚Äôs icon and then select ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù from the menu. A security warning
  will appear, but this time it will give you the option to ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù the app anyway. Click this option.
  - **For Linux users:** Right-click on the app‚Äôs icon and look for ‚ÄúRun as Administrator‚Äù or ‚ÄúRun as Root‚Äù.
  Click this option. The app should now open.
  - **For Windows users:** Right-click on the app‚Äôs icon and look for ‚ÄúRun as Administrator‚Äù. Click this
  option. The app should now open.
  
Once the app is opened, the first thing to do is to log in with your username and password! Fill in, and press the login button. If you have a valid account, you should now be logged in and see the chat screen. If you don't have access to the platform please see the section called [üì• How to get access].

## login window
Here is how the login window looks like:
![rolv desktop app login page](login_page.png)


## Testing if R works
The next step is to let RolvDesktop know where it can find your R installment! A default path has already
been set for you, but this might not be the correct one.

To check if the app can find your R installation, click
Set R path in the Menu Bar. Then, by clicking Test R path, we can see if RolvDesktop can find your R
installation. If R is available, you should see a popup on the right side of the screen telling you that R is
working.

![setting up and checking R path](set_R_path_menu.png)


## If R is not Available or can not be found

If R is not available or can not be found at default locations, you will see an error pop up. 
![R not found pop up](set_r_path_popup.png)



If this is the case, follow these steps to determine where
your R resides in your system:

1. First, we open up the terminal/PowerShell:
  - On Mac: Press Cmd + Space, type in Terminal, and press Enter.
  - On Linux: Press Ctrl + Alt + T to open the terminal.
  - On Windows: open PowerShell by pressing Win + X and selecting Windows PowerShell.
  
2. Now, we look for the Rscript file within the system:
  
    - On Mac/Linux type in the following command:
    
      `whereis Rscript`
    
      This should return the location of Rscript. Copy this path so we can paste this path into RolvDesktop.
    - On Windows type in the following command:
      ```{r eval=F}
       Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -Filter "Rscript.exe" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
      ```
    This should return the location of Rscript. However, we cannot just paste the path in there as is.
    Ensure that the C:\ is deleted, and all the backslashes \ are changed to forward slases / before
    pasting the path in the app.
  
  
Once you have located the path of Rscript, we can now let RolvDesktop know. To set the R path, go to
Set R path in the Menu bar. Then, press set path of R executable and select paste path manually.
A pop-up should now appear where you can paste the path to Rscript.
Paste the path to Rscript, click submit, and now R should be available to RolvDesktop! You can check this
by pressing Test R path again.

If everything is OK, you should now be able to see the main interface and should be able to start your journey.

![chat interface](chat_interface.png)



# Configuration & Preferences
Currently only important configuration you have to make is setting a working directory 
The app will look for the data mentioned in your prompts/questions in this directory. 
This is explained in detail below in the next section. 

The other options there are as follows (and also explained below):

  - **Activate auto execution** : any code that will be generated by rolv will immediately be executed automatically. 
  - **Activate file header addition** : This will add the first two lines of any files you mention in your question and send it to rolv app.
  - **Activate self-correct** : Currently not functional. It is intended to feed execution errors automatically to LLM and get corrected code. However, same functionality can be achieved on the chat interface by asking to correct the code when you receive an error.

# Usage Guide
## How to use the basic chat interface
To give you an example of the basic usage, we ask the bot to simulate data and 
do some basic analysis. Here is how it would look like:
![simulation question](question_pax6_expression.png)


And here is the result of the simulation and analysis:
![simulation question result](output_pax6_expression.png)


## Analyzing your data stored on your computer

While simulating data can be useful, analyzing real-world data is far more insightful. Fortunately, ROLV
can generate code based on files in your system. For example, if you have gene expression data stored in
gene_expression.txt, you can inform ROLV about the file, and it will tailor its code accordingly. To specify
the file‚Äôs location, simply open the Chat options menu from the left sidebar. A dropdown menu opens,
where we can press Select directory:

![Select directory](select_directory.png)




A file dialog will open, from which you can select the directory in which your files are. Any subdirectories
within that directory will also be searched. Once we have done this, we have a few other options that we can use.
When we turn on Activate auto execution, any code that will be generated by ROLV will immediately
be run. We can also turn on Activate file header addition. This will add the first two lines of any files
you mention in your question and send it to ROLV. For now, lets turn on Activate file header addition
and ask some questions about our file gene_expression.txt:


```{r eval=F}
I have a file called gene_expression.txt, which holds
gene expression data of different samples. Samples are on the
columns and genes are on the rows. Could you make a boxplot
of the average gene expression over different samples for
the first 5 genes?

```

![Question about a local file](gene_expression_question.png)

![Results from running the code](gene_expression_result.png)



As we can see from the example above, the code that ROLV gives back is now based on the file mentioned in
our question! So we can ask questions and run code based on data that we have from our actual experiments!
But ROLV can not only summarize our data and give us a nice visual representation of it, we can also ask it
to do any other type of analysis for us. The possibilities are endless!

## Doing literature search

ROLV is not only able to assist you with writing coding pipelines, it is also able to help you during your literature
search. Let's say we quickly want to pull up some information on PAX6: we can ask ROLV to give us some usefull information
with links to PubMed articles:

```{r,eval=F}
Could you give me some information about PAX6 and its function within the cell?
```


![PAX6 literature search](pax6_literature_search.png)

As you can see from the above screenshot, a whole list of articles is returned with information about PAX6 and its function within the cell.
There are also links provided to the articles so you can verify the information yourself, and use proper references to the actual articles
which the information came from!

## Doing data set search 


ROLV can also help you find relevant datasets directly within the app by integrating with public repositories such as GEO. This makes it easy to identify experimental data that matches your research context (e.g., tissue type, species, perturbation, or technology used).

one example question we could ask is the following:
```{r,eval=F}
Find me ChIP-seq datasets for TGFbeta in liver tissue.
```

![TGFbeta ChIP-seq search](GEO_question.png)

As shown above, ROLV will return a list of matching datasets with some additional information and links to the relevant datasets. You can click on the links provided to access the full dataset and metadata.

## AI-assisted workflow creation

ROLV allows you to build flexible, modular workflows that combine multiple data analysis steps‚Äîwithout having to manually code each component. Using the graph interface, you can create, edit, and execute complex pipelines visually or via chat.

To begin building such a pipeline, we can click the graph interface icon on the sidebar. This will open a graph interface containing a single node. From this node, we can either paste in some pre-existing code into the code interface, or start chatting via the chat with me button. 

Now that we are all set, let‚Äôs start the conversation, and ask the same question we asked before about our file
gene_expression.txt:

![Graph interface request](graph_interface_quest.png)

We get back an answer with code again! However, now instead of the button Execute code, we can see two other buttons on top of the answer: Copy and Replace. To understand what these buttons do, you can open the coding interface of the node by pressing the Show code button. For now, this is empty. However,watch what happens when you now click the Copy or Replace button. The code is copied over to the coding
interface, and now you can click the Execute code button to execute it and see the results! Here you can also change any existing code, or even make entire snippets yourself. 


![Graph interface request](graph_interface_codeint.png)

__Note:__ When the coding interface is empty, the buttons Copy and Replace will do the same thing. However,
if there already is some code present in the coding interface, Copy will just copy the code from ROLV to the
coding interface and paste it at the bottom. Pressing Replace however, will delete the existing code in the
interface, and replace it with the new code from ROLV. So be careful which one you press!





Now you might be thinking... is this not the exact same thing we did with the chat
interface? Yes and no! So far what we have done could also be done in the chat interface, but now lets add
another node to the graph! To do this, we first close the code and chat interfaces by clicking on the Hide
code and Chat with me button. You should see another black button with a white ‚Äò+‚Äô sign on the right side
of the node. Once you press this, ROLV will gather suggestions on what types of analysis you could do based
on the analysis that is already there. From this, you can choose on of the options that ROLV gives you, or
create an empty node and chat about the type of analysis you want done after your first node.

![New node options](new_node_options.png)

As you can see in the above image, we have 2 options to choose from: 

- Perform hierarchical clustering
- Create a heatmap visualization


Let‚Äôs press the second option and see what happens:
![Added node to the graph](added_node.png)


There is a new node added to the graph! If we now press on Show code, we can see that there already is
code present, showing us how to create a heatmap. When we now press Execute code, all the code from its
parental nodes (in this case our gene expression node) is first run, after which the code within the node itself
is run. If we open the chat interface by pressing Chat with me, we can view the full coding analysis as it
runs and chat with ROLV to ask questions or request modifications. However, if we know exactly what type
of modifications we want to make, we can also edit the code ourselves. 


## Ask A Human Feature: 

AI gets you far, but sometimes you need human expertise. When you‚Äôre stuck, we provide an option to connect with data analysis experts through our platform. As of currently, this feature will only work when you are in the main chat interface. If you are chatting with our AI assistant, but you are stuck on a problem, click on the human button on the top right corner of the screen:

![Location of ask a human button](ask_human_button.png)


Clicking this will open the popup menu below. Here you can write your question about the currently open chat, and this will send you message to our data analysis experts together with your chat history. We will then get back to you as soon as possible!

![Ask a human pop-up](ask_human_html.png)
