# Installation Instructions
## System Requirements
Any hardware that is able to run a recent chrome browser should be able to run the desktop app.
However for smooth performance we have the following reccomnedations:

- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (2 GHz+).
- **RAM**: 8 GB+ for resource-heavy apps (e.g., IDEs, communication tools).
- **Storage**: SSD for faster load times (1 GB free storage)
- **Internet connection**: Required as the app relies on web APIs for certain services.


## Install the dependencies
Currently, the only external dependency that that doesn't come with the app is **R**. R is a free, 
open-source programming language and software environment primarily used for statistical 
computing and data analysis. Currently, we need this depency to perform data analysis tasks.
If you already have R installed, you can skip this step. It is probably a good idea
to use a latest version of R though.

# Starting the app and post-installation verification
Now that we have all the prerequisites installed, we can start playing around with RolvDesktop! If you have
trouble opening the app because of security reasons, follow the steps below:

  - **For Mac users:** Right-click on the app‚Äôs icon and then select ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù from the menu. A security warning
  will appear, but this time it will give you the option to ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù the app anyway. Click this option.
  - **For Linux users:** Right-click on the app‚Äôs icon and look for ‚ÄúRun as Administrator‚Äù or ‚ÄúRun as Root‚Äù.
  Click this option. The app should now open.
  - **For Windows users:** Right-click on the app‚Äôs icon and look for ‚ÄúRun as Administrator‚Äù. Click this
  option. The app should now open.
  
Once the app is opened, the first thing to do is to log in with your username and password! Fill in, and press the login button. If you have a valid account, you should now be logged in and see the chat screen. If you don't have access to the platform please see the section called [üì• How to get access].

## login window
Here is how the login window looks like:
![rolv desktop app login page](login_page.png)


## Testing if R works
The next step is to let RolvDesktop know where it can find your R installment! A default path has already
been set for you, but this might not be the correct one.

To check if the app can find your R installation, click
Set R path in the Menu Bar. Then, by clicking Test R path, we can see if RolvDesktop can find your R
installation. If R is available, you should see a popup on the right side of the screen telling you that R is
working.

![setting up and checking R path](set_R_path_menu.png)


## If R is not Available or can not be found

If R is not available or can not be found at default locations, you will see an error pop up. 
![R not found pop up](set_r_path_popup.png)



If this is the case, follow these steps to determine where
your R resides in your system:

1. First, we open up the terminal/PowerShell:
  - On Mac: Press Cmd + Space, type in Terminal, and press Enter.
  - On Linux: Press Ctrl + Alt + T to open the terminal.
  - On Windows: open PowerShell by pressing Win + X and selecting Windows PowerShell.
  
2. Now, we look for the Rscript file within the system:
  
    - On Mac/Linux type in the following command:
    
      `whereis Rscript`
    
      This should return the location of Rscript. Copy this path so we can paste this path into RolvDesktop.
    - On Windows type in the following command:
      ```{r eval=F}
      Get-ChildItem-Path C:\-Recurse-Filter "Rscript.exe"-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
      ```
    This should return the location of Rscript. However, we cannot just paste the path in there as is.
    Ensure that the C:\ is deleted, and all the backslashes \ are changed to forward slases / before
    pasting the path in the app.
  
  
Once you have located the path of Rscript, we can now let RolvDesktop know. To set the R path, go to
Set R path in the Menu bar. Then, press set path of R ececutable and select paste path manually.
A pop-up should now appear where you can paste the the path to Rscript.
Paste the path to Rscript, click submit, and now R should be available to RolvDesktop! You can check this
by pressing Test R path again.

If everthing is OK, you should now be able to see the main interface and should be able to start your journey.
